  <h1>Epicodus Tunes Review</h1>

  <div class="blog1">
    <h2>System of a Down</h2>
    <h3>Album: Toxcity</h3>
    <p>Wake up! This album is awesome, it's time to listen to it. Wake up, grab a keyboard and make a little shake up. This album helped pioneer a mood and shift in the nu-metal genre, exploring basdic yet very raw and gain heavy guitar riffs. A perfect tracklist for the moshpit.</p>

    <h2>Humanity's Last Breath</h2>
    <h3>Abyssal Mouth</h3>
    <p>Just let me rest, longing for a dealthy silence. Swallow me whole, abyssal mouth. Be ready for one of the most face crushing, black metal infused albums of 2019. HLB delivers new atmoshperic tones and and sound that comes from the deepest depths of Mariana's Trench.</p>

    <h2>The Wiggles</h2>
    <h3>Toot Toot!</h3>
    <p>The Wiggles, that wacky, kid-wowing Australian outfit, welcome preschoolers for a lively, loopy musical fiesta with Toot Toot! Chiming in on this 23-track charmer of a dance- and sing-along are the usual wiggly suspects: Captain Feathersword relates how he loves to dance in his pirate pants on the spoken-word "Raincoat Story"; Henry the Octopus's "marvelous talent" for baking, roasting, and frying seaweed pies is celebrated on "Henry the Octopus"; and Henry's tireless tentacles also inspire the next get-you-moving tune, "Move Your Arms Like Henry."</p>
